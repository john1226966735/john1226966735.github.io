I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Sun Yat-sen Univerisity (SYSU), excepted to graduate in 2026. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jiahai Wang. Before this, I received my Ms.Eng Degree from Central China Normal University and B.Eng. Degree from Tianjin University.

My current research interests mainly lie in Reasoning with LLMs (especially in Mathematical Reasoning), Tool/Memory Augmented LLMs, LLM-based Agents.
