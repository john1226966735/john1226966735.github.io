I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Sun Yat-sen Univerisity (SYSU), excepted to graduate in 2026. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiahai Wang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2551). 
Prior to this, I completed my M.Eng Degree at Central China Normal University in 2022 under the guidance of [Prof. Jianwen Sun](http://faculty.ccnu.edu.cn/h5/2012980010). I earned my B.Eng. Degree from Tianjin University in 2018.

My current research interests mainly lie in Reasoning with LLMs (especially in Mathematical Reasoning), Tool/Memory Augmented LLMs, LLM-based Agents.
