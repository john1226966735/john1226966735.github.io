I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Sun Yat-sen Univerisity (SYSU), excepted to graduate in 2026. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiahai Wang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2551). Before this, I received my Ms.Eng Degree from Central China Normal University in 2022 and B.Eng. Degree from Tianjin University in 2018.

My current research interests mainly lie in Reasoning with LLMs (especially in Mathematical Reasoning), Tool/Memory Augmented LLMs, LLM-based Agents.
